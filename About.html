<div class="about">
    <p>Using bright colors, hard work and experience, Rachel Roy loves to create little pieces that reflect who she is. She is passionate about the little things; like the gray hairs of a dog or the bright colors of a house that is decorated in holiday lights.</p>

    <p>She also is a photographer that takes pictures of what she sees in the world, nature, animals, and friendships. If requested, she can help take pictures for prom, yearbook photos, wedding photos, and more.</p>

    <p>Rachel is also a big fan of jewelry making and loves Christmas, she takes her love of both to create different pieces that she sells and keeps. She also takes a portion of her earnings and she donates it to those in need.</p>

    <p>Rachel takes a lot of her inspiration from her pet dog, Milo, and many other dogs that she takes care of. As well as an artist she also pet sits so she has a lot of time with animals, mainly dogs.</p>
